Hi! I'm **Matías**, a software developer in training from Argentina 🇦🇷, passionate about learning and building things with code.

Currently, I work at [@Kyndryl](https://www.kyndryl.com/us/en) as an **Accounting Systems Analyst**, where I deal with SAP FI configurations, foreign currency valuation and translation, and automation of financial processes.

I'm currently studying for an **Associate Degree in Programming, Computer Science at UTN (Universidad Tecnológica Nacional)** and learning to code through self-study and hands-on projects.

I'm building my skills in:

- `C#` and `.NET` (focused on backend development)
- `Python` (for scripting and automation)
- `SQL` and basic data handling
- Software development best practices (SOLID, clean code, Git, etc.)
